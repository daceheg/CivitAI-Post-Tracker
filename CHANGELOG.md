# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- Post reaction totals are now derived by summing per-image stats for each post instead of reading the post-level rollup, which was stale and frequently reported zero reactions for recent posts. Totals now reflect current reaction counts on every run, including older posts whose reactions change over time.
- Dashboard **Day** period filter now uses a rolling 24-hour window, matching the Week/Month/Year filters. Brand-new posts published shortly before local midnight are no longer dropped from the Day view at the day boundary.

### Changed
- Image fetching is scoped to the posts in the tracking window (batched by post ID and fetched in parallel) rather than pulling the whole catalog, and post pagination now stops early once it passes the tracking window, so runs over a small window are substantially faster.
- Rate-limited (HTTP 429) and transient server (5xx) responses are retried with backoff, honoring `Retry-After`. When an image fetch is incomplete, the affected per-post totals fall back to the post rollup and are flagged rather than shown as zero.
- The dashboard now reports where each post's totals came from (summed image stats vs. post rollup) instead of naming a single fixed source.

## v10.6.0

### Added
- Dashboard motion for cards, charts, numeric counters, workspace switches, hover states, and the detail drawer.
- Desktop UI fade-in/fade-out for the main window, setup wizard, settings, diagnostics, and update dialogs, with a subtle activity-feed and update-badge motion.
- Scroll-reveal and workspace reflow animation for dashboard sections, cards, and filtered rows.
- Reduced-motion handling so users who disable motion get a static dashboard.

## v10.5.0

### Added
- First-run setup wizard for profile, access mode, tracking start point, and initial scan.
- Background update availability checks while the app is open.
- Main-window update marker on the **Updates** action when a newer release is available.

## v10.4.1

### Added
- Analysis-ready data export from the desktop app and CLI.
- `analytics_export/` output with posts, snapshots, snapshot-to-snapshot deltas, images, and export metadata.
- Optional image metadata storage for width, height, prompt, negative prompt, model, sampler, steps, CFG, and seed when those fields are available from CivitAI responses.
- Export metadata notes for currently unavailable view-count fields.
- Sample elapsed/distance columns for first-window reaction aggregates.

## v10.4.0

### Added
- Performance board on the dashboard with compact cards for recent momentum, collection movers, and fresh posts.
- Timing board with compact cards for best posting hours, weekdays, and recommendation basis.
- History board with compact cards for all-time and early-window leaders.
- Dashboard smoke coverage for the Performance, Timing, and History boards plus card-to-detail-drawer wiring.

### Changed
- Collection event storage and dashboard details now stay focused on image/post analytics and aggregate collection context.
- Project documentation now focuses on current usage, with old release-body drafts removed from the active doc set.
- Source-mode fallback launch scripts now fail with clearer setup guidance when Python or UI dependencies are missing.
- `install_requirements.bat` now validates Python 3.11+, backs up unusable local environments, installs dependencies into `.venv`, and verifies CustomTkinter.
- Dashboard guide now describes the Performance view as both a compact board and detailed table.

## v10.3.1

### Changed
- Simplified Collections activity rows in the Dashboard.
- Removed a low-value collection event metadata column from user-facing collection activity views.

## v10.3.0

### Added
- CustomTkinter-based desktop UI refresh.
- Bundled Exo 2 and Russo One font assets for consistent app typography.

### Changed
- Main window layout now keeps Activity and the status footer visible at the default size.
- Settings, Updates, and Diagnostics use the refreshed UI surfaces, larger readable text, and styled scrollable text areas.
- Diagnostics now opens with the health details visible without requiring the user to stretch the window.
- Secondary windows now use larger minimum sizes so important controls are visible on open.

## v10.2.1

### Fixed
- Fresh posts now appear in Dashboard Performance quick filters immediately after their first captured snapshot.
- Period filters now consider a post's publish date as well as reaction/comment/collection gains, so first-seen posts are not hidden from Day, Week, Month, or Year views.

## v10.2.0

### Added
- In-app Update Center for release checks, release notes, package downloads, and compatible EXE updates.
- Optional background update check on launch.
- Automatic update applier for packaged EXE builds, including backups and updater logs.
- Visible app version in the desktop UI.
- `Exit app` button for fully closing the tracker from the main window.
- `package_release.bat` for creating portable Windows release ZIPs.
- Manual **Select ZIP** fallback, retry handling, and release-note mirror support for update packages.

### Changed
- EXE builds now install project dependencies into `.venv` before PyInstaller runs.
- EXE update package selection rejects source ZIP files and requires the portable app layout.
- Mirror package URLs are preferred over GitHub Release assets when a release provides one.

## v10.1.1

### Added
- `launch_tracker.pyw` as the supported no-console source launcher.
- `launch_tracker.bat` as a visible-console troubleshooting fallback.
- Single-instance guard per app folder.

### Changed
- Source-mode autostart uses the windowed launcher.
- EXE build flow prefers the local `.venv` and isolates user-site packages.
- Frozen startup prepares bundled Tcl/Tk paths before Tkinter imports.

## v10.1

### Added
- Post performance table with current totals, recent gains, early snapshots, collection activity, image count, and last-seen data.
- Lazy thumbnail previews and post detail drawer.
- Visual overview charts.
- Tabbed Analytics workspace for Performance, Collections, Timing, and History.
- Search, recent-activity filtering, image-only filtering, and period filters.
- Preview columns for collection image tables.
- Image URL storage in `post_images`.

### Changed
- Replaced the lower stack of collapsible dashboard tables with the Analytics workspace.
- Image-only collection rows link directly to CivitAI image pages and use `Post mapping not found locally`.
- Preview fallbacks use aligned thumbnail-sized slots.
- Dashboard sorting uses explicit numeric/date sort values.

## v10.0.1

### Added
- Collection sync state storage.
- Bootstrap and maintenance sync modes.
- Collection coverage metadata and partial-history warnings.
- Collection diagnostics in `logs/core_last.log`.
- Smoke tests for collection parsing, config compatibility, sync state, ingest mode switching, and dashboard file writes.

### Changed
- Collection sync supports nested and legacy config shapes.
- Cursor handling avoids invalid `cursor=Date` requests.
- Runtime paths for database, CSV, dashboard HTML, and API key file are resolved relative to `config.json`.
- New configs use `options.enable_collection_tracking`; `options.enable_buzz_ingest` remains a compatibility alias.

## v10.0

### Added
- Collection tracking for images.
- Incoming content engagement storage in `content_engagement_events`.
- Image-to-post correlation for collection events.
- Collections dashboard section.

### Notes
- Collection tracking requires API key access.
- Without an API key, the app runs in limited public mode: collection tracking is unavailable and restricted or NSFW posts may be missing or incomplete.
