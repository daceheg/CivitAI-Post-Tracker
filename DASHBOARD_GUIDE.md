# Dashboard Guide

The dashboard is a local HTML analytics view generated from the tracker database. It reflects collected snapshots and events; it is not a live CivitAI page.

## Main Sections

### Summary

The top summary shows the current tracking scope, known/unknown totals, daily reaction movement, best post today, and best post over the last 7 days.

Daily and weekly blocks use period gain, not lifetime totals.

### Visual Overview

The chart area shows:

- daily reaction gains and collection additions for recent local days;
- reaction mix for the current local day;
- top post movement based on recent reaction and collection activity.

Charts are rendered inside the generated HTML and do not require external scripts.

Dashboard motion is visual polish only. Cards, charts, workspace switches, filters, and the detail drawer may animate when the browser allows motion.

### Suggested Posting Windows

Suggested windows are calculated from historical performance. Treat them as hints, not rules. Small samples, unusual posts, content mix changes, and platform behavior can skew the result.

### Analytics Workspace

The workspace groups detailed tables into tabs:

- **Performance**
- **Collections**
- **Timing**
- **History**

The workspace includes table search, recent-activity filtering, image-only row filtering, and quick period filters for Performance and Collections:

- Day
- Week
- Month
- Year
- All time

## Performance View

The Performance tab starts with a compact board for scanning:

- recent momentum;
- collection movers;
- fresh posts.

Clicking a performance card opens the same detail drawer as the table.

The full Performance table remains below the board as the detailed per-post monitoring view. It usually includes:

- post link;
- thumbnail preview when a stored preview URL is available;
- published time;
- current reactions and comments;
- average reactions per day;
- reaction/comment gain today and over the last 7 days;
- first 2h and first 24h snapshots when enough early data exists;
- collection additions;
- image count;
- last seen / last update.

Clicking a table row opens a detail drawer with a larger preview, compact metrics, post link, primary image link, and stored image links.

Older local image rows may not have preview URLs yet. If an image ID is known, the dashboard falls back to an `Open image` link. Otherwise it shows `No preview` until a later tracker run stores more image metadata.

## Collections

Collection tracking uses authenticated transaction data and maps image-level collection events back to tracked posts when the image is known locally.

Collection views focus on tracked images, posts, and aggregate collection counts.

The Collections views show:

- collection additions;
- affected images;
- affected posts;
- a recent collection flow;
- top affected posts;
- top collected images;
- image-only events that are not mapped to a local post yet.

Rows marked `Post mapping not found locally` are image-level events that could not be mapped to a local post in `post_images`. The dashboard still links those rows to the CivitAI image page.

Collection image previews use the same thumbnail-sized slot as normal previews. If a preview URL is missing or blocked by the current browser/session, the fallback opens the image page without shifting the table layout.

The Collections workspace uses compact cards instead of a stack of separate tables. Search, quick period filters, and the image-only toggle still apply to those cards.

Clicking a collection card opens the same detail drawer pattern used by the Performance tab, with image/post links and compact collection context.

## Timing

The Timing tab starts with a compact board for scanning:

- best local posting hours;
- best local weekdays;
- the recommendation basis used for the current scoring.

The detailed tables remain below the board. They show ranked timing candidates and the underlying publish-hour / weekday summaries from the local database.

Timing suggestions are calculated from historical performance. Treat them as hints, not rules. Small samples, unusual posts, content mix changes, and platform behavior can skew the result.

## History

The History tab starts with compact leader cards for:

- all-time reaction leaders;
- best captured first-day windows;
- best captured first-2h windows.

Clicking a History card opens the same post detail drawer used by Performance cards. The full leader, early-window, and recent-post tables remain below the board.

## API Key Effects

Without an API key, collection tracking is unavailable and restricted or NSFW content may be incomplete.

Removing the key does not hide rows already stored in the local database. It only affects what the tracker can fetch on future runs.

## Time And Freshness

Dashboard periods use the configured local timezone. The Day, Week, Month, and Year filters are rolling windows ending at the current time (last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 365 days) — not calendar boundaries.

Each post's reaction totals are summed from the stats of that post's images, fetched fresh on every run. This reflects current reaction counts even on older posts, whose totals can keep changing over time. When images for a post cannot be fetched, the dashboard falls back to the post-level total and marks it accordingly; the data-source note shows how many posts used summed image stats versus the fallback.

The header includes a `generated ...` timestamp. If the dashboard looks stale, run the tracker again and confirm that timestamp changed.

The dashboard page auto-refreshes itself every 5 minutes. This reloads the local HTML view; it does not trigger a tracker run or fetch new CivitAI data. Background polling is controlled by the app's polling interval.

If dashboard motion is not visible, check Windows **Accessibility > Visual effects > Animation effects** and the browser's reduced-motion setting. The dashboard intentionally reduces animation when reduced motion is requested.

## Raw Export

For external analysis, use **Export data** in the app instead of scraping the dashboard HTML. It writes clean CSV files for posts, snapshots, deltas, images, and export metadata.

## Limits

The dashboard is a decision aid. It does not predict future performance, judge content quality, or guarantee that a suggested time window will outperform another one.
