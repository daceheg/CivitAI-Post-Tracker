# CivitAI Tracker

A Windows-first local desktop app for tracking CivitAI post performance, collection activity, CSV snapshots, and a generated HTML dashboard.

The app keeps its runtime data on your machine. It can run from source or as a portable PyInstaller EXE build.

## Unofficial Tool And Platform Terms

CivitAI Tracker is an unofficial community tool. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by CivitAI.

The app is intended for local personal analytics for a user's own CivitAI account and content. Users are responsible for complying with CivitAI's terms, platform rules, and applicable law.

Do not use this project to:

- bypass authentication, age gates, access controls, or content restrictions;
- scrape unrelated users or platform data at scale;
- manipulate CivitAI statistics, engagement, Buzz, rankings, or visibility;
- automate likes, comments, collections, follows, or other engagement actions;
- collect personal data without consent;
- package the project as a hosted paid analytics service or commercial redistribution that implies project or platform endorsement.

The source code is licensed under the MIT License. That license grants broad rights to use, copy, modify, and distribute the code. The statements above are project policy and usage guidance; they do not grant permission to violate CivitAI terms or imply that commercial services built from this project are endorsed or supported by the maintainers.

## What It Does

- Tracks CivitAI posts from a configured start point.
- Stores current reaction/comment totals and historical snapshots in SQLite.
- Exports local CSV snapshots and a clean analytics CSV package.
- Generates a local HTML dashboard with boards, tables, preview thumbnails, charts, and collection analytics.
- Uses subtle motion in the desktop UI and dashboard, while respecting reduced-motion system/browser settings.
- Tracks collection additions for your images when authenticated access is available.
- Runs manual checks or automatic polling from a tray-enabled desktop UI.
- Checks GitHub Releases for portable EXE updates and marks the Updates action when a newer version is available.

## Requirements

- Windows is the primary target for the packaged EXE. Source mode also runs on Linux and macOS — see [Running on Linux](#running-on-linux).
- Python 3.11 or newer for source mode and local builds.
- A CivitAI API key is recommended and required for collection tracking.
- Desktop fonts are bundled with the app; users do not need to install them separately.

## API Key And Limited Mode

The app can start without a CivitAI API key. In that state it runs in limited public mode.

Without an API key:

- the main app should still open;
- public post checks can still run when CivitAI exposes the data publicly;
- collection tracking is unavailable;
- user-scoped transaction data is unavailable;
- restricted or NSFW posts may be missing or incomplete;
- dashboard totals may be incomplete for accounts that publish restricted content.

For full tracking, especially collection activity and restricted-content visibility, configure an API key in **Settings**.

The key can be stored inline in `config.json` or in a separate file such as `api_key.txt`. Do not commit either file.

## Quick Start: Source Mode

Install dependencies:

```powershell
.\install_requirements.bat
```

Launch the app:

```powershell
.\launch_tracker.pyw
```

On a new app folder, the desktop UI opens a first-run setup wizard for profile, access mode, tracking start point, and the optional first scan.

For advanced or headless setup, copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and edit it before launch.

For fallback startup with console diagnostics:

```powershell
.\launch_tracker.bat
```

For direct development troubleshooting:

```powershell
.\dev_run_tracker.bat
```

`launch_tracker.pyw` is the supported no-console source launcher. The `.bat` launchers are fallback tools for setup and startup diagnostics.

## Running on Linux

Source mode is pure Python (`requests` + Tk-based UI), so the tracker runs on Linux and macOS as well. The `.bat`/`.pyw` launchers are Windows conveniences; on other platforms use the cross-platform launcher.

Install dependencies (a virtualenv is recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The desktop UI uses Tk. On minimal distros, install the system Tk bindings (the Python `tkinter` module is not bundled by `pip`):

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

Launch the desktop app:

```bash
python civitai_tracker.py            # same flags as the .pyw launcher
python civitai_tracker.py --minimized
```

`civitai_tracker.py` is the supported cross-platform source launcher. It accepts the same arguments as `launch_tracker.pyw` (`--minimized`, `--setup`, `--version`) and uses a project-local `.venv` if one is present.

> **Tray caveat.** The system-tray icon relies on `pystray`, whose behavior varies across desktop environments. It works on most X11 setups; some Wayland sessions do not expose a legacy tray, in which case the icon may be missing while the app still runs normally.

### Headless / server use (no GUI)

For servers or containers without a display, run the tracker without the desktop UI and serve the generated dashboard:

```bash
python tracker_service.py --export-analytics
```

This writes the analytics dataset and refreshes `dashboard.html` without opening a window. See [Analytics Export](#analytics-export) and `DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md` for details. Updates on Linux are done through Git (see [Updates](#updates)); the Windows-only auto-apply updater is not used.

## Quick Start: EXE Mode

Build the portable app locally:

```powershell
build_exe.bat
```

The build script creates and uses `.venv`, installs `requirements.txt`, installs PyInstaller, verifies runtime imports, and builds from that same environment.

Run:

```text
dist\CivitAITracker\CivitAITracker.exe
```

For a release ZIP:

```powershell
package_release.bat
```

The package is written to `release\CivitAITracker-v<version>-win64.zip`.

## Configuration Basics

The first-run wizard covers the required fields for normal use. The same values live in `config.json`, and common options can be edited later from **Settings**.

Most-used config keys:

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "username": "",
    "timezone": "UTC"
  },
  "auth": {
    "api_key": "",
    "api_key_file": "api_key.txt"
  },
  "tracking": {
    "start_mode": "post_id",
    "start_post_id": null,
    "start_date": null,
    "poll_minutes": 15
  },
  "paths": {
    "analytics_export_dir": "analytics_export"
  },
  "options": {
    "check_updates_on_launch": true,
    "enable_collection_tracking": true
  }
}
```

Automatic polling is intentionally conservative. The default is 15 minutes, and values below 5 minutes are raised to 5 minutes to avoid overly frequent CivitAI requests. Dashboard auto-refresh reloads the local HTML page every 5 minutes; it does not start a new CivitAI fetch by itself.

Collection tracking options are under `collection_tracking`. The default config separates the first bootstrap sync from later maintenance syncs:

```json
{
  "collection_tracking": {
    "account_type": "blue",
    "bootstrap_max_pages": 100,
    "maintenance_max_pages": 10,
    "overlap_hours": 24,
    "max_history_days": 120,
    "http_timeout_seconds": 60
  }
}
```

## Dashboard

The dashboard is generated as `dashboard.html` and opened from the desktop app. It includes:

- current tracking status;
- reaction and comment totals;
- daily and weekly movement;
- visual overview charts;
- suggested posting windows;
- post performance board and full table with quick period filters;
- timing board for best posting hours and weekdays;
- history board for all-time and early-window leaders;
- collection activity cards, image queues, and collection context;
- thumbnail previews and post detail drawer when image metadata is available.

Dashboard motion is intentionally cosmetic. If Windows or the browser asks for reduced motion, animated transitions are reduced or disabled.

See `DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md` for interpretation notes and known limits.

## Analytics Export

Use **Export data** in the desktop app to write analysis-ready files to `analytics_export/` by default:

- `posts_summary.csv`
- `post_snapshots.csv`
- `post_deltas.csv`
- `post_images.csv`
- `export_metadata.json`

The export is UTF-8 CSV with comma separators and stable filenames. Timestamps are ISO 8601; UTC fields use `Z`, and local fields use the configured profile timezone. Unknown values are left blank.

The export is meant for external analysis rather than dashboard viewing. You can load it into pandas, spreadsheets, scripts, or other analysis tools to inspect posting history and growth patterns.

View-count columns are present for schema stability, but the CivitAI source currently used by the tracker does not provide view counts, so those fields are blank. Tags and image metadata are filled only when the current source returns them; image metadata is refreshed during normal tracker runs.

From source mode, the same export can be generated without fetching new data:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tracker_service.py --export-analytics
```

## Updates

Source-mode users update through Git, then rerun `install_requirements.bat`.

EXE users can use **Updates** in the app to check the latest GitHub Release, download a compatible portable ZIP package, and apply it automatically. Automatic apply is available only in the packaged EXE build.

When update checks are enabled, the app checks in the background on launch and periodically while it stays open. If a newer release is found, the main Updates action shows a small marker.

The updater preserves local runtime data and stores replaced app files under `updates\backup-<timestamp>\`. Keep your own backup of `config.json`, `api_key.txt`, and `civitai_tracker.db` before major updates.

See `UPDATE_GUIDE.md` for update, rollback, mirror, and release-package details.

## Local Data And Privacy

Runtime files are local and should not be committed:

- `config.json`
- `api_key.txt`
- `civitai_tracker.db`
- `csv/`
- `analytics_export/`
- `logs/`
- `dashboard.html`
- `runtime_status.json`
- `updates/`

To track multiple CivitAI accounts, use separate app folders. Each folder keeps its own config, API key file, database, logs, and dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

Open **Diagnostics** in the app first. It checks configuration, paths, API-key availability, and write access.

Run smoke tests:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tests\smoke_tests.py
```

Check the latest run summary:

```powershell
Get-Content .\logs\core_last.log
```

If collection tracking is empty, check that:

- an API key is configured;
- collection tracking is enabled;
- the account has recent collection events;
- `logs\core_last.log` does not report `collection_ingest.reason: API key required`.

If the dashboard looks stale, run the tracker again and check the `generated ...` timestamp in the dashboard header.

If UI or dashboard animations are not visible, check Windows **Accessibility > Visual effects > Animation effects**. The app follows that setting where possible.
